**Shotlink** is a lightweight and efficient REST API service written in Go that allows you to capture high-quality screenshots of websites programmatically. Designed for developers, automation tools, monitoring systems, and visual reporting platforms, Shotlink leverages Chrome Headless via `chromedp` to render fully interactive web pagesâ€”including dynamic JavaScript content and custom styles.

# How to use

1. **Make a request**: Send a GET request to `https://snaptor.nexvul.com/get?url=<URL>`, replacing `<URL>` with the website you want to capture.
2. **Receive the screenshot**: The server will respond with a PNG image of the website screenshot.

# Example request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://snaptor.nexvul.com/get?url=https://example.com" -o screenshot.png
```

# Requirements

- Go 1.18 or later

- `emulation` package for viewport emulation
- `context` package for managing request context
- `time` package for request timeout
